# Query.php

The file [query.php](database/query.php) is placed in the root directory of my *[OpenShift](openshift.redhat.com) [database server](http://database.roryclaasen.me)*. The reason for this is due to the lack of dart libraries that can deal with [sql](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) on a browser and not running from [dart vm](https://www.dartlang.org/dart-vm).
